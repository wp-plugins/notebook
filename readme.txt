A widget that exposes private categories, useful for navigation especially if you want to use wordpress as a diary or a notebook. 
Take note that private categories won't still be included in the count as this is technically a wordpress categories widget, 
except that it shows all categories.

We made this widget so that people who don't know how to code doesn't need to quit using wordpress if they needed this feature.
